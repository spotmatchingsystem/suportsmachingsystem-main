# spotmatchingsystem

A new Flutter project.

## Web: SVG assets

If SVGs (e.g. logo, hero graphic) **briefly show then disappear** on Flutter Web:

- **Use a recent Flutter:** CanvasKit is now the default (no `--web-renderer` flag). Run with `flutter run -d chrome` or **“Flutter (Chrome)”** in VS Code; build with `flutter build web`.
- **After changing assets:** `flutter clean && flutter pub get`, then full restart.

See [docs/WEB_SVG.md](docs/WEB_SVG.md) for full details and troubleshooting.
